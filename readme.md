# 🛸 FPV Drone Signal Reverse Engineering Lab

An advanced research project to decode and control undocumented FPV drones using WiFi-based UDP packet reverse engineering.  
**No SDKs. No APIs. Just raw data, smart observation, and Python.**

## 📡 Overview

This repository is a reverse engineering sandbox for a toy FPV drone that lost its remote.  
By capturing the communication between the official mobile app and the drone over WiFi, we isolated individual payloads and recreated control using a custom-built Python UDP script.

> All testing was done blind, with no access to the drone’s source code, APIs, or official documentation.  
> Every feature you see here was discovered manually — one packet at a time.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

| 🚀 **Drone Takeoff**         | Fully working takeoff command replicated via PC       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎮 **Payload Mapping**       | Reverse engineered each action (takeoff, throttle, yaw...) |
| 📦 **PCAP Reverse Engineering** | Manual decoding of `.pcap` files with Wireshark    |
| 🧪 **Payload Test Harness**  | Python script to loop/send payloads in milliseconds    |
| 🕹️ **Planned WASD Control** | Full keyboard control (W, A, S, D + Space) in progress |
