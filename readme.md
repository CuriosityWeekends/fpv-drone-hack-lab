# FPV Drone Signal Reverse Engineering Lab üõ∏

An advanced research prototype designed to analyze, decode, and replicate undocumented UDP-based control signals used by commercial FPV drones.

Built from scratch by reverse-engineering proprietary communication protocols using raw packet captures, custom socket payloads, and iterative drone behavioral testing.

## üöß Project Overview

This repository serves as the foundation for a deep-dive exploration into real-time command and control (C2) signal replication of toy-grade FPV drones.

### Core Goals:
- üì° Decode application-to-drone payloads via packet capture and protocol fingerprinting
- üîÑ Simulate behavioral equivalents using direct UDP payload injection
- üî¨ Analyze signal delta changes in throttle, yaw, pitch, and system arming

The challenge lies in *analyzing undocumented and proprietary byte-level payloads* in a real-time environment, without SDKs or vendor tooling. All experimentation is done blind, using PCAP inspection and pattern testing.

## üß† Techniques Applied

- **Payload Pattern Differentiation** using PCAP signal diffing
- **Socket-Level Packet Reconstruction** via Python‚Äôs `socket` module
- **Live Feedback Loop Testing** for real-world control replication
- **Byte Manipulation Hypothesis Testing** to reverse-map behavioral triggers
- **Protocol Reverse Engineering** using Wireshark, tshark, and byte delta decoding
