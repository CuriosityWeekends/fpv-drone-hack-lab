# 🛸 FPV Drone Signal Reverse Engineering Lab

An advanced research project aimed at decoding and controlling undocumented WiFi-based FPV drones using raw UDP signals — without vendor SDKs or APIs.

Built from scratch by analyzing packet captures, isolating payloads, and testing direct socket injection to replicate flight control behavior.

## 📡 Project Overview

This repository contains everything needed to reverse-engineer and control a toy-grade FPV drone via UDP packets, using nothing but WiFi, PCAP captures, and Python.

This drone had no official documentation or development kit — all commands were deciphered manually from raw network captures.

🧠 Techniques Applied
Payload Pattern Differentiation using Wireshark

Socket-Level Packet Reconstruction via Python’s socket module

Live Payload Testing to identify effects (takeoff, throttle, etc.)

Manual Reverse Engineering of undocumented drone protocols

🚧 Current Capabilities
Feature	Status
Takeoff command injection	✅ Working
Motor activation payload	✅ Identified
Throttle pattern testing	🧪 In progress
WASD flight control system	🔧 Planned
Full protocol map	🔬 Building

🧬 Future Plans
Build a GUI to control the drone like a flight simulator

Add keyboard support (W, A, S, D, SPACE) using pynput

Expand payload mapping to include flips, pitch, yaw, etc.

Auto-capture payloads from live PCAPs and generate tests

📜 Background
This project was born from necessity. The full story is available in docs/origin_story.md.
